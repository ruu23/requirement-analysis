Requirement Analysis
What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, and defining the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.
It serves as the foundation of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) because it ensures the project’s goals are clear before development begins.

During this phase, business analysts, developers, and stakeholders collaborate to:

Understand what the user wants.

Translate those needs into technical requirements.

Document and validate them for clarity and feasibility.

A well-conducted Requirement Analysis minimizes misunderstandings, prevents scope creep, and ensures that the final product meets the customer’s expectations.

Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Prevents Miscommunication
It ensures all stakeholders share a common understanding of what the system should do, avoiding costly misunderstandings later.

Defines Clear Scope
It sets the project boundaries, identifying what is included and what is not — reducing the risk of scope creep.

Improves Quality and Efficiency
Clear, well-documented requirements lead to better design decisions, smoother development, and fewer revisions during testing.

Saves Time and Cost
Identifying issues early in the analysis phase is much cheaper and faster than fixing them during or after development.

Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Gathering
Collecting stakeholder needs through interviews, questionnaires, surveys, and observation.

Requirement Elicitation
Refining and clarifying gathered information using brainstorming sessions, workshops, and prototyping to discover hidden needs.

Requirement Documentation
Creating detailed artifacts such as Software Requirement Specifications (SRS), user stories, and use cases for developer reference.

Requirement Analysis and Modeling
Examining requirements for feasibility, consistency, and completeness, and representing them through diagrams or models.

Requirement Validation
Reviewing requirements with stakeholders to confirm they are correct, complete, and aligned with business goals.

Types of Requirements
Functional Requirements

Functional requirements define what the system should do — the core features and behaviors.
They describe actions, processes, or services the system must perform.

Examples (Booking Management System):

Users can search for available properties by location, price, and date.

The system should allow user registration and secure login.

Users can book and cancel reservations.

Admins can add, edit, or remove property listings.

The system sends email confirmations for successful bookings.

Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements define how the system should perform.
They focus on quality attributes such as performance, security, and reliability.

Examples (Booking Management System):

The website should load within 2 seconds under normal conditions.

All sensitive data must be encrypted using SSL/TLS.

The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users.

The interface must be mobile responsive.

The application should maintain 99.9% uptime.

Use Case Diagrams

A Use Case Diagram visually represents the interaction between users (actors) and the system (use cases).
It helps identify who uses the system and what actions they can perform.

Benefits:

Simplifies complex system interactions.

Clarifies system boundaries.

Improves communication between stakeholders and developers.

Below is the use case diagram for the Booking Management System, showing main actors and their interactions.

Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria are the conditions that a software feature must meet to be accepted by stakeholders or end-users.
They define the boundaries of a user story and help developers and testers confirm when a feature is complete and functioning as expected.

Importance:

Ensures the developed feature meets business and user needs.

Provides a clear checklist for testing and validation.

Prevents ambiguity between stakeholders and developers.

Example (Checkout Feature):

Feature: Checkout Process

Acceptance Criteria:

The user must be able to view booking details before payment.

The system must validate payment information before processing.

Payment confirmation must be displayed upon successful checkout.

The system should send a confirmation email to the user automatically.

If payment fails, an error message should be shown with retry options.
