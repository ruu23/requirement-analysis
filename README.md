## 🧠 What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of **identifying, gathering, and defining** what users and stakeholders need from a system.
It’s one of the most important phases in the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** because it lays the foundation for successful design and implementation.

💡 During this phase:

* Stakeholders express their **needs and expectations**.
* Analysts translate them into **technical requirements**.
* Teams ensure those requirements are **clear, testable, and achievable**.

📘 In short — Requirement Analysis ensures everyone knows *what to build* before starting *how to build it*.

## 🌟 Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Understanding requirements early saves time, money, and effort later. Here’s why it matters:

1. 🗣️ **Prevents Miscommunication**
   Ensures all stakeholders and developers share the same understanding of the project goals.

2. 🎯 **Defines Clear Scope**
   Establishes system boundaries and prevents **scope creep** (unplanned feature additions).

3. ⚡ **Improves Efficiency & Quality**
   Clear requirements allow developers to focus on delivering exactly what’s needed — reducing rework.

4. 💰 **Saves Time & Cost**
   Fixing requirement issues early is cheaper and faster than addressing them post-development.

## 🧩 Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Here are the 5️⃣ essential activities that make up this process:

* 🔍 **Requirement Gathering**
  Collecting stakeholder needs through interviews, surveys, and observations.

* 💬 **Requirement Elicitation**
  Refining gathered data using brainstorming, workshops, or prototyping sessions.

* 📝 **Requirement Documentation**
  Writing detailed documents like **Software Requirement Specifications (SRS)** and **User Stories**.

* 🧮 **Requirement Analysis & Modeling**
  Studying requirements for consistency, feasibility, and dependencies. Often includes creating **UML diagrams** or **models**.

* ✅ **Requirement Validation**
  Reviewing and confirming requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.

## ⚙️ Types of Requirements

### 🔹 Functional Requirements

Describe **what the system should do** — its *features, functions, and actions.*

**Examples (Booking Management System):**

* 🔍 Search for available properties by date, price, or location.
* 🧾 Book and cancel reservations.
* 👤 Register new users and secure login.
* 🏡 Admin can add/edit/delete property listings.
* ✉️ Send email confirmations after successful bookings.

---

### 🔸 Non-Functional Requirements

Describe **how the system should perform**, focusing on *quality attributes* like speed, security, and reliability.

**Examples (Booking Management System):**

* ⚡ The website should load in **under 2 seconds**.
* 🔐 Use **SSL/TLS encryption** for all sensitive transactions.
* 👥 Handle up to **10,000 concurrent users**.
* 📱 Ensure **mobile responsiveness** across devices.
* 🕒 Maintain **99.9% uptime** availability.

## 🎭 Use Case Diagrams

A **Use Case Diagram** shows *who* interacts with the system and *what actions* they can perform.
It helps visualize **functional interactions** clearly between **actors** (users/admins) and **use cases** (system functions).

✨ **Benefits:**

* Simplifies complex user interactions.
* Enhances communication between stakeholders and developers.
* Defines system boundaries clearly.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

**Acceptance Criteria** are the **conditions** a feature must meet to be considered *complete and acceptable* by stakeholders.
They guide developers and testers to verify that the implementation matches expectations.

💡 **Why It’s Important:**

* Clarifies what “done” means.
* Reduces ambiguity during development.
* Helps QA teams write accurate test cases.

### 🛒 Example: Checkout Feature

**Feature:** Checkout Process in the Booking Management System

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. 🧾 User can view booking details before payment.
2. 💳 System validates payment info before processing.
3. ✅ Payment confirmation appears after successful checkout.
4. 📧 Confirmation email is automatically sent to the user.
5. ⚠️ If payment fails, show an error message with retry options.

## 🚀 Summary

Requirement Analysis isn’t just documentation — it’s the blueprint for success.
By understanding **what** users need and **how** the system should behave, we build software that’s reliable, efficient, and user-centered.
